# MatchingGame

This is a color matching game implemented on the Nexys 3 Spartan 6 FPGA board.

For setup, use the USB port to upload the game through ISE and connect a monitor through the VGA port. 
Once the game is setup correctly, you should see a 4x4 gameboard on the screen. 
Use the buttons on the board to move around (btnU, btnD, btnL, btnR).
Use the middle button (btnS) to select and reveal a card.
You can reveal up to two cards at the same time. If the two cards are of the same color, then you will eliminate a pair.
The 7-seg display tells you the number of cards yet to be eliminated. 
You can always reset the game by using the slide switch closest to the buttons (T<10>).

Good luck and have fun!
